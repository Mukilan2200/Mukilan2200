Hi, I’m Mukilan Karikalan, a 14-year-old student at Ambassador International Academy in Dubai, UAE. I have always been passionate about technology, problem-solving, and innovation. As my school’s Digital Innovator and a former PYP Head Boy, I thrive on finding creative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Over the years, I’ve received multiple awards, recognizing my knowledge, leadership, and collaborative spirit.

From a young age, I’ve loved working with computers. Whether it’s building websites, coding games in Scratch, or experimenting with hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I enjoy every step of the process. Right now, I’m focused on developing StudentSync, a productivity app designed to help students stay organized. I’m coding it in Swift using Xcode. Alongside that, I’m also learning web development and exploring new ways to build efficient, user-friendly applications.

Beyond coding, I have a strong interest in engineering and robotics. I’m part of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) team, Legoneers, where we work on innovative projects related to underwater exploration. I’m also building an underwater ROV, applying my knowledge of electronics and programming to real-world challenges. My projects don’t stop there—I’ve worked on Arduino-based builds like a sonar scanner and a reaction speed tester, constantly pushing myself to learn and improve.

Academically, I excel in science and math, with a preference for physics over biology. I approach my studies with a structured, analytical mindset, focusing on patterns, justifications, and problem-solving. I also participate in Model United Nations (MUN), where I represent countries like Russia and debate global issues such as cryptocurrency regulation. I keep my speeches short, impactful, and well-researched, ensuring that I leave a strong impression.

Outside academics, I have a passion for chess and love playing badminton. I also enjoy learning new languages—I’m currently studying French and German because I dream of traveling the world and experiencing different cultures.

In the future, I aspire to become a software engineer and create technology that makes life easier. I’m always looking for ways to innovate, whether it’s through apps, robotics, or AI-driven solutions. Hopefully you had fun reading this big bio about me.
